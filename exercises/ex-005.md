# TDD Exercise 005: Bowling Game Scoring

In this exercise, you'll use **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to implement the rules of bowling using **JavaScript classes**. Follow the step-by-step instructions to write tests and build the logic for a bowling game scoring system.

---

## Objective

Create a `BowlingGame` class that calculates the score of a bowling game based on the following rules:

### Bowling Scoring Rules:

1. A game has **10 frames**.
2. Each frame allows up to **two rolls** to knock down 10 pins.
3. **Spare**: If all 10 pins are knocked down in two rolls, the player gets a bonus of the next roll's score.
   - Example: 5 + 5 (spare) + 7 (next roll) = 17.
4. **Strike**: If all 10 pins are knocked down in the first roll, the player gets a bonus of the next two rolls' scores.
   - Example: 10 (strike) + 3 + 4 (next two rolls) = 17.
5. In the **10th frame**, players can roll a third time if they score a spare or strike.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Setup the Project

1. Create the folder structure:
   ```plaintext
   src/
   â”œâ”€â”€ bowlingGame.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ bowlingGame.spec.js
   ```
````

---

### Step 2: Write the First Test

1. Open `bowlingGame.spec.js`.
2. Write a test for initializing a game with no rolls:

   ```javascript
   const { BowlingGame } = require('../src/bowlingGame');

   describe('Bowling Game', () => {
     test('should start with a score of 0', () => {
       const game = new BowlingGame();
       expect(game.getScore()).toBe(0);
     });
   });
   ```

3. Check the test:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test will fail because `BowlingGame` and `getScore` don't exist yet.

---

### Step 3: Implement `BowlingGame` with `getScore`

1. Open `src/bowlingGame.js` and implement the basic structure:

   ```javascript
   class BowlingGame {
     constructor() {
       this.rolls = [];
     }

     getScore() {}
   }

   module.exports = { BowlingGame };
   ```

2. Check the test again:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test should pass.

---

### Step 4: Write a Test for Rolling Pins

1. Add a test for recording a roll:
   ```javascript
   test('should record a roll and calculate score', () => {
     const game = new BowlingGame();
     game.roll(5);
     expect(game.getScore()).toBe(5);
   });
   ```
2. Run the test:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test will fail because `roll` is not implemented yet.

---

### Step 5: Implement the `roll` Method

1. Modify `BowlingGame` to include `roll`:

   ```javascript
   class BowlingGame {
     constructor() {
       this.rolls = [];
     }

     roll(pins) {
       this.rolls.push(pins);
     }

     getScore() {}
   }

   module.exports = { BowlingGame };
   ```

2. Run the test again:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test should pass.

---

### Step 6: Add a Test for a Spare

1. Add a test for scoring a spare:
   ```javascript
   test('should calculate score with a spare', () => {
     const game = new BowlingGame();
     game.roll(5);
     game.roll(5); // Spare
     game.roll(3);
     expect(game.getScore()).toBe(16); // 5 + 5 + 3 (bonus) + 3 = 16
   });
   ```
2. Run the test:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test will fail because spare logic is not implemented.

---

### Step 7: Implement Spare Logic

1. Modify `getScore` to handle spares:

   ```javascript
   class BowlingGame {
     constructor() {
       this.rolls = [];
     }

     roll(pins) {
       this.rolls.push(pins);
     }

     getScore() {
       return score;
     }
   }

   module.exports = { BowlingGame };
   ```

2. Run the test again:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test should pass.

---

### Step 8: Add Tests for a Strike

1. Add a test for scoring a strike:
   ```javascript
   test('should calculate score with a strike', () => {
     const game = new BowlingGame();
     game.roll(10); // Strike
     game.roll(3);
     game.roll(4);
     expect(game.getScore()).toBe(24); // 10 + 3 + 4 (bonus) + 3 + 4 = 24
   });
   ```
2. Run the test:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test will fail because strike logic is not implemented.

---

### Step 9: Implement Strike Logic

1. Modify `getScore` to handle strikes:

   ```javascript
   getScore() {
     return score;
   }
   ```

2. Run the test again:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   The test should pass.

---

## Final Steps

1. Add tests for edge cases (e.g., perfect game, gutter game).
2. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

---

## Summary

By completing this exercise, you've implemented the rules of bowling using TDD and JavaScript classes. You've learned to:

1. Start with failing tests.
2. Implement logic step by step to pass tests.
3. Refactor and repeat.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ³
