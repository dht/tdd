# Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Web Development

Welcome to the **TDD for Web Development** repository! This repo is designed for beginners learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) as part of a web development course.

## What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests **before** writing the actual code. The cycle typically follows these three steps:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for a new feature or function.
2. **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring the test still passes.

TDD ensures your code is reliable, maintainable, and meets the requirements from the start.

## Why TDD?

- **Improves Code Quality**: Encourages simple, efficient, and bug-free code.
- **Speeds Up Debugging**: Tests identify issues before they reach production.
- **Ensures Features Work**: You know your code meets requirements because you wrote tests for them.

## Folder Structure

This repository contains the following:

```plaintext
.
├── src/          # Your application code
├── tests/        # Test files
├── README.md     # You are here!
└── package.json  # Project dependencies and scripts
```
````

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. A testing framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tdd-webdev.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Writing Your First Test

1. Create a test file in the `tests` folder (e.g., `tests/sum.test.js`).
2. Write a failing test:

   ```javascript
   const sum = require('../src/sum');

   test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
     expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
   });
   ```

3. Write the code to pass the test in `src/sum.js`:

   ```javascript
   function sum(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   }

   module.exports = sum;
   ```

4. Run your test:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   Your test should pass!

### TDD Workflow

- **Write a failing test**: Start with the requirements.
- **Make the test pass**: Write the simplest code possible.
- **Refactor**: Clean and optimize your code.

## Example Topics

This course covers:

- Writing tests for functions and components.
- TDD for backend APIs.
- TDD for frontend interactions.
